	- M:
	- You chose to work in computer science when this was not such an
	- obvious career choice.  Can you tell us about how you made this choice
		- and what you think in retrospect about this choice?
- K:
	- It's true that I started working with computers probably in the mid to
		- late sixties, when things were fairly early on, and it was entirely by
			- accident.  I think I saw my first computer in 1963; it was an old IBM

		- 650.  I didn't do any serious programming until in 1964 when I was in
			- my last year of college.  But it was fun, and it was before computer
				- science was in any sense a field.  When I went to graduate school
- there was a Computer Science program in the Electrical Engineering
- Department at Princeton.  This was fairly typical of a lot of places:
	- computer science was not a separate academic field, it was just part
		- of some department that might have a computer or people interested in
		- computation, so I just backed into it, entirely by accident.  This has
	- been a lucky accident, because obviously the field has had a lot of
- interesting things happen.
- M:
- You've been in this area for a long time, and you've been a very
	- important player in the evolution of computer science.  Some of your
		- work has had a profound impact.  Can you point out some things that
			- you consider fundamental advances in computer science in the last 30
			- years, some changes of paradigm that have happened?
